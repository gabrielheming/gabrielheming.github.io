Five years passed, and I realised that I still had a blog about software development. So many things have happened during this period, and I think it is worth sharing.

When I first began writing, my goal was to share my findings on software development that could be of interest to fellow developers. Initially, I focused primarily on PHP development. However, as of 2016, I have expanded my focus to other languages and systems.

As time passed and thanks to a wonderful opportunity in my career, I began exploring a new brand new world called M[Microsoft Dynamics AX][ax2012]. Working with Dynamics AX, I have learned to program in [X++][x++]. X++ is an object-oriented language with similarities to C# and it is part of the MorphX development platform.

After a while, I also dived into [Microsoft Dynamics AX for Retail POS][pos]. All the customisations on the POS are achievable through the [Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF)][mef]. From this project, I got more experience in C# and the .NET Framework, and I started moving from a PHP developer to a Dynamics AX and .NET developer.

Things got a bit wild in my life when I started transitioning to the Microsoft ecosystem. This led me to work with .NET Core and relocate to Europe.

Although there are numerous details from the end of 2018 until now, I do not believe they are pertinent at this time. Nevertheless, getting back on track and writing good stuff about software development is my primarly goal.
