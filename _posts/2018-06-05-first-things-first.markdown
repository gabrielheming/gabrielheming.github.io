So, here we are and here we go.

For the first time, after a long time with the "willing" feeling, I've created this blog to talk about code 
in general and on development in any language/software. I'll talk about the day to day of a software developer 
and many programming languages implementations.

Before I forget, who writes to you is Gabriel Heming. I'm graduated in Software Analysis and Development, 
and I have a Specialization in Software Development. I have experience in many programming languages and 
for the last 8 year I've focused almost exclusively for the study ofObject Oriented design and software
architecture.

*So, enjoy the code!*
