For now on I'm going to post here in English and possibly in Portuguese (I'm still reading about to make this blog multi-language).

It's a matter of fact that English is very important in a programmer life and this is the first step that I'm making to improve my writing skills.

Let me know any tips that you can give to me, it's very important to me.
